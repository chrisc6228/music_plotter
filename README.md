Sheet music notator written in Python based on spectrograms

About: Notating music based on recordings and improvisation can be very consuming. This project aims to mimic the way how we percieve sound and use discrete Fourier Transforms to 
map tones to time instances. It utilizies numpy, matplotlib, and the sounddevice libraries. This notator, when fully completed, should be able to sense sound in the interval of C3-C5 for all instruments.
